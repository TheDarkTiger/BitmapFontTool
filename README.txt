=Bitmap Font Tools=

A collection of tools to work with bitmap fonts
For now, only writer is published.
Later, a font converter, and maybe more, idk.

==Writer==
I was just tired to copy/paste bitmap fonts...
So give this script some bitmap font and some text, and it will export a nice image for you.

As a side note, I found some nice oldschool bitmap fonts online with a strange format.
A white pixel is before each letter, in one single line.
I didn't know that, but it turns out that a program existed back in the day and took that font format to draw images.
Unfortunately, it's not active, let accesible, anymore.
You can find it for historcal purposes (thanks Way Back Machine!) :

The options don't seems too hard to implement, and the format is smart, so, maybe I will add the options of this old program to BFTwriter...
